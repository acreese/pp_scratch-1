With the advent of the internet and the lowering of communication barriers, peer production communities have experienced much growth and interest. As many enterprises seek to embrace the benefits of open source, understanding the principles that drive these projects has become more important. According to Benkler (2016), open source is dictated by the following principles: decentralization of conception and execution, diverse motivations, and the separation of organization from property and contract. One community that has adopted some open-source principles is TEDx, which are community-run offshoots from its parent organization, TED. This paper focuses on comparing and contrasting the traits of TEDx and a specific TEDx organizer, TEDxTAMU, with those that are found in open source communities. Some insight about TEDxTAMU will be provided by Andrew M., an operations leader within TEDxTAMU who agreed to be interviewed for this paper. 


## Background: TED

TED brands itself as a global community for sharing ideas, while "independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world" ("Our organization", n.d.). These ideas are shared through "short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less)" ("Our organization", n.d.). The focus of this paper is TEDx, although we need some background on TED before delving into TEDx and TEDxTAMU. TED originally started as a conference in 1984, and as the organization evolved and changed leadership, emphasis has gradually shifted from the physical conference to TED Talks, a "collection of ... prior TED presentations delivered [for] free [via the Internet]" (Lewis, n.d.). Presentations at TED conferences were traditionally done by what organizers called "thinkers", "doers", and "idea-generators", boasting a past speaker list that includes Bill Clinton, Pope Francis, Bill Gates, and many Nobel Prize winners ("TED Speakers | TED", n.d.). With the success of these TED talks from people at the top of their fields, TED, in 2009, launched TEDx, where anyone can organize community-based events focused around ideas worth sharing from local presenters. 

## Background: TEDxTAMU

Besides being affiliated with TED, TEDxTAMU is also a student organization within Texas A&M. However, it is not a standalone student organization, its umbrella organization is MSC ALOT, which aims to provide leadership experiences for freshmen ("MSC ALOT", n.d.). This is an important distinction as it affects the membership and tenure length of TEDxTAMU participants. The organization is structured like a tree, with an executive director at the top followed by group leaders that manage aspects such as operations, speaker relations, etc., then sub subcommittees with the final bottommost layer being approximately a hundred freshmen (Andrew M., personal communication, March 6, 2021). Members can climb the ladder if they choose to by applying and being picked by group leaders. 

## Comparison of open source principles
Each aspect needs to be considered from both the organizers perspective (TEDxTAMU) and the individual speakers who participate in the event.


### Decentralization of conception and execution

In many open source communities, the original idea is conceived by a smaller group of people than those who end up contributing and maintaining the project. TEDxTAMU does not follow this trait in the traditional open-source sense, but some decentralization can be seen from the relationship between the speakers and the conference organizers. The organizers conceive the annual conference theme, then put out a request for speaker nominations before executing all the logistical matters for the event. However, the talks given by speakers originate from the speakers themselves, as long as the talk falls in line with the particular year's theme. Speakers are largely left to their own devices when it comes to their talks, as a sample of their work is required for their nomination, so the organizers are usually able to pick ones who have a well thought-out idea to spread. The organizers will provide critique and assist speakers in polishing their talk to be concise, but the talk's ideas and execution are largely attributed to the speaker. 


### Harnessing diverse motivations

One hallmark of successful open source communities is its ability to attract participants with diverse motivations, whether people are joining for the opportunity to learn, have fun, network, or build their resume. 
In a paper exploring the motivation of why people volunteer time towards contributing to Wikipedia, the author found that fun and ideology were the two primary motivating factors of Wikipedia editors (Nov, 2007). While interviewing Andrew M., the same motivation can be found, as he cited having fun in his first year and gaining leadership experience that classes cannot offer as part of the reasons he returned to TEDxTAMU for his sophomore year (personal communication, March 6, 2021). He also mentioned that he believes in TED's motto, which is "ideas worth spreading" (TED, n.d.). Andrew M.'s motivations are likely mirrored by many of the TEDxTAMU participants, although it would be remiss to forget that some may have only joined for a resume boost, as leadership positions are highly coveted and well-received on resumes. Furthermore, freshmen typically have less leadership options due to inexperience, so MSC ALOT and TEDxTAMU are able to motivate people by lowering barriers to leadership positions. It is clear that TEDxTAMU is able to harness diverse motivations, at least from the perspective of the organizers. 
Speakers do not share an inherent trait that the organizers do, as all organizers are students attending Texas A&M. However, while the topics that speakers choose to cover are different and their motivations may vary, each speaker shares a similarity in that they all believe in the idea they are trying to spread. TEDxTAMU gets around 150-200 speaker nominations for each conference, and a sample of the speaker's work is an important factor when considering which speakers to choose (Andrew M., personal communication, March 6, 2021). The sample of work is usually enough to be able to consistently pick speakers who are passionate and eager to spread their ideas, which is completely different from the motivations of the organizers as they work to provide the platform. 


### Separation of governance and management from property and contract

An interesting aspect of TED and TEDx is that all talks given by speakers are actually property of TED. People are welcome to share the talks under Creative Commons if it is for a non-commercial purpose, but TED will charge money if the content is used for commercial purposes. TED also has an entire webpage dedicated to how and what medium talks may be shared as, for instance, you must use TED's video player for tracking purposes ("TED Talks Usage Policy", n.d.). This means that while TEDxTAMU provides most of the effort in hosting conferences, they have no ownership. Speakers also have no ownership right. Another interesting point within TED's usage rules is that the user cannot add more restrictions on top of TED's existing ones if they are to share TED content for non-commercial purposes  ("TED Talks Usage Policy", n.d.). This is a trait that is echoed in a well-known open source license, the GNU General Public License (GPL). The GPL license "contains the restriction that anybody can use the licensed material, for any purpose, so long as they subsequently offer the same restriction" (Kelty, 2008, p.182). The separation between management and property can commonly be found in peer production communities, participants rarely have ownership over what they contribute and that ownership is instead passed to the organizing body. While this may seem like a weird setup to people concerned about ownership due to monetary reasons, TEDx speakers make a tradeoff between ownership and a broader platform. TEDxTAMU provides speakers with a platform that they typically would not have access to, and this platform is critical in amplifying their ideas. Particularly well thought out and produced TEDx talks may even end up on the main TED channel where there is a potential audience of millions. Besides a broader platform, during our interview, Andrew M. also mentioned that the TED branding evokes trust and reputability, which are qualities that a speaker as an individual may not have access to (personal communication, March 6, 2021).

One of the governance models for open source communities is the benevolent dictator, where "final decision-making rests with one person" ("Benevolent Dictators", n.d.). The relationship between TED and TEDxTAMU can be likened to an extremely hands-off benevolent dictator. TED approves TEDx organizers based on an application and has the power to revoke the license that TEDx organizers need to operate. TED provides all the rules and regulations that TEDx offshoots must follow, but according to Andrew M., TED is actually rather difficult to contact when nuances arise (personal communication, March 6, 2021). When situations that are not encompassed by the provided rules arise, the discretion is left mostly to the TEDx organizers. TEDx organizers are trusted with a good amount of autonomy, but this can be a double-edged sword.  In 2010, after outcry about a TEDx talk titled "Vortex-Based Mathematics", where one comment described the talk as "sweet merciful crap", TED was forced to respond publicly and ultimately release new content guidelines for the TEDx community (Merchant, 2014). Much time has passed since that controversy occurred, but this example serves as a reminder of the potential consequences of too much openness without appropriate safeguards.


## Collaboration

Due to the distributed nature of open source communities, many rely on email lists and other online platforms to keep members up to date and share knowledge. TEDxTAMU, in contrast, conducts weekly meetings in order to delegate work and ensure that everything is running smoothly. Part of why this works is because (in normal non-COVID times) everyone is physically located in the same vicinity. Even though people are geographically in the same location, Andrew M. did note during the interview that a lot of trust is necessary for the organization to run, as members need to trust that others will get their work done. In terms of collaboration tools, TEDxTAMU utilizes Google Drive as a knowledge base and ledger of activities for the past three to four years. A newer feature of Google Drive is that it now saves versions of documents and has the ability to restore older versions. There is a parallel that can be drawn between this functionality in Google Drive and what functionality Github, a site that houses many software development-based open source communities, provides (or other Git-based repository websites). While Google Drive doesn't have commit messages, diff logs, or other descriptions for older versions, the ability to track changes through time is the same. When the Google Drive knowledge base is unable to answer questions, TEDxTAMU members are still able to get in contact with previous members who are willing to help out if asked. 


## Challenges

The goal of TEDx across local communities is to make content similar to TED talks more accessible, a departure from the original TED conference that had strictly vetted speakers with high financial barriers of attendance. However, the dichotomy between openness and quality will likely always cause friction for TEDx organizers. Previous controversies involving TEDx include allowing speakers whose talks were not based on science, causing enough public scrutiny to prompt a response from TED. TED's website now also includes an entire section on not including bad science in a talk, warning of "especially severe" consequences if pseudoscience is allowed ("TEDx Rules", n.d.). Besides ensuring the quality of speakers, TEDxTAMU in particular must work within a budget when hosting a conference. Items such as videographers and editors need to be financially feasible for the organizers. TED talks are usually well produced with high audio and video quality, but obviously, TEDx organizers more than likely do not have the resources that TED does. Another challenge that may be of concern for TEDxTAMU is the continuity of the organization. The organization seems to be primarily driven by momentum, which works as long as they continue forward but interruptions could have negative effects. However, due to TEDxTAMU's unique structure of being under the umbrella of MSC ALOT as well as Texas A&M University, perhaps the organization will continue to thrive as long as there are speakers who are eager to spread their ideas. During our interview, Andrew M. noted that the TED brand held enough appeal and reputation that they as organizers do not need to actively seek out speakers (personal communication, March 6, 2021). 


## Conclusion

While TEDx and subsequently TEDxTAMU do not exhibit all principles that distinguish open source communities, the separation between governance and property is present along with the balancing act between openness and quality. TEDx has undoubtedly spread the influence of TED to more communities than the original reach of the TED conference, but mismanaged TEDx organizers have also done the TED brand a disservice in the past. TEDxTAMU is able to use the reputability of TED to attract speakers, and its unique structure of being both under an important campus entity and university is likely to aid its longevity.
